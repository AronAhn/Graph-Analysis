# Chapter 3. Graph Theory

## 3.1. Origins of Graph Theory
- A graph is a mathematical object that describes relationships between items
- Graph theory has become useful in the study of social networks for several reasons
  - It provides a *vocabulary* that can be used to label and denote many social structural properties
  - It provides the use of many *mathematical operations* and *ideas* that help quantify and measure many of the social strucctural properties
  - Graph theory gives a way to *prove theorems* of graphs and *representations of social structure*
