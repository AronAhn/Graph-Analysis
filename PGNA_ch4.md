# Chapter 4. Social Networks

## 4.1. Social Networks
- A social network is a social composition of actors and relationship defined on them
  - Actors can be persons, places, organizations, roles, etc
  - Relationship can be kinship, friendship, knowledge, acquaintance, correspondence, etc
- Every actor in the network can be connected to one or more other actors to from eventually a structure that represents the social tissu for that individual
- Social networks can be grouped into two types:
  - One-mode network: A network that include one type of nodes to represent actors, subgroups, or communities
  - multi-mode network: A network that include more than one type of nodes

## 4.2. Properties of a Social Network

### Scale-Free Network
- Networks whose degree distribution obeys a power law: ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?P%28k%29%20%5Csim%20K%5E%7B-%5Cgamma%7D)
- Degree distribution is calculated as follows: ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?P_k%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7Bn%7D%20%5C%23%20%5C%7B%20i%7Ck_i%20%3D%20k%20%5C%7D)
- Many network ind=cluding citation network, biological network, WWW graph, ... haver right-skewed or power-law degree distribution
- Power-law distribution means that few nodes account for the vast majority of linke, while most nodes have very few links
- In these network, a small number of well-connected nodes, which is called hubs, significantly reduce the diameter of the entire network
